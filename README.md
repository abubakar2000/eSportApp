# eSportApp
## PreReqs
### You must have xcode and xcode command-line tools.
### Second thing we require is expo-cli "npm i -g expo-cli"
### You must have vscode with react native extension, nxconsole makes things easier but not important.
### For android testing you must have android sdk

## How to run
>To run this app you must install expo-cli (makes things easier as compared to the bare react-native)
> Run command 'npm run ios' to run the app in your ios simulator.
There are other options there as well, you can press 'w' while running so it shifts app to browser, similarly press 'a' in terminal while running to open android emulator. But android sdk must be installed for that.
